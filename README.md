## Basic responsibilities of a general insurance actuarial analyst
Before working on the project, it's important to build a solid foundation in the key topics we'll need to understand. This preparation will ensure we have the tools and knowledge necessary to approach wer tasks with confidence and skill.

1. Risk assessment

As an actuarial analyst, the primary role is to assess risks. This involves analyzing data to identify potential risks that an insurance company might face. we will use statistical models and historical data to predict the likelihood of future events, such as natural disasters, accidents, or other claim-triggering incidents. Accurate risk assessment is crucial for setting appropriate premiums and ensuring the financial stability of the insurance company.

2. Pricing

One of the core responsibilities is determining the pricing of insurance policies. This process, known as ratemaking, involves calculating the premiums that policyholders must pay. we will use various actuarial methods, such as experience-based rating, which relies on historical claims data to set rates. The goal is to balance competitiveness with profitability, ensuring that the premiums are sufficient to cover future claims and expenses while remaining attractive to customers.

### Reserving

Actuarial analysts must ensure that the insurance company sets aside sufficient reserves to pay future claims. This involves estimating the amount of money needed to cover claims that have been reported but not yet settled, as well as claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported. Accurate reserving helps maintain the financial health of the company and ensures that it can meet its obligations to policyholders.

### Financial reporting

we will also be responsible for providing detailed financial reports to management. These reports include analyses of the company's claims experience, loss ratios, and overall financial performance. wer insights will help inform strategic decisions, such as setting underwriting guidelines, developing new insurance products, and adjusting pricing strategies.

### Regulatory compliance

Compliance with regulatory requirements is another critical aspect of this role. we must ensure that the insurance company's pricing models and reserves meet the standards set by regulatory bodies. This involves staying up-to-date with changes in regulations and ensuring that all actuarial practices are in line with legal requirements.

## Basics of marine insurance perils and coverages
### Overview of marine insurance

Marine insurance provides coverage for ships, cargo, terminals, and any transport or cargo by which property is transferred, acquired, or held between the points of origin and final destination. It plays a crucial role in international trade, safeguarding against various risks associated with maritime activities.

### Common marine insurance perils

Marine insurance covers a wide range of perils that can cause damage or loss. Some of the most common include:

*Sinking*: When a vessel goes down due to severe weather, collision, or other catastrophic events.
*Collision*: Damage resulting from a vessel colliding with another ship, a stationary object, or submerged rocks.
*Piracy*: The criminal act of attacking and robbing ships at sea, which can lead to loss of cargo and vessel damage.
*Fire*: Fires can occur on ships due to various reasons, including onboard accidents or external factors like lightning strikes.
*Weather*: Severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, typhoons, and storms can cause significant damage to vessels and cargo.

### Types of marine insurance coverages

Marine insurance policies are designed to cover specific types of risks and can be tailored to meet the needs of different stakeholders. Key coverages include:

*Hull insurance*: Covers physical damage to the ship itself, including the machinery and equipment onboard.
*Cargo insurance*: Protects against loss or damage to the goods being transported. This coverage can be extended to cover different stages of transit, including loading and unloading.
*Freight insurance*: Ensures the shipowner or charterer is compensated for lost income if the cargo is lost or damaged.
*Protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance*: Provides coverage for third-party liabilities, including injuries to crew and passengers and damage to cargo or other ships.

### Marine Third-Party Liability

Marine Third-Party Liability insurance, a crucial aspect of P&I coverage, specifically covers the shipowner's legal liabilities to third parties. This can include:

*Bodily injury or death*: Liability arising from injury or death of third parties, including passengers and crew members.
*Property damage*: Damage caused by the insured vessel to other vessels, docks, cargo, and other properties.
*Pollution liability*: Coverage for expenses related to oil spills or other types of marine pollution caused by the insured vessel.
*Wreck removal*: Costs associated with the removal of the wreckage of the insured vessel if it sinks or is otherwise rendered inoperable.
