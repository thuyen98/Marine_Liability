## I. Basic responsibilities of a general insurance actuarial analyst
Before working on the project, it's important to build a solid foundation in the key topics we'll need to understand. This preparation will ensure we have the tools and knowledge necessary to approach wer tasks with confidence and skill.

### 1. Risk assessment

As an actuarial analyst, the primary role is to assess risks. This involves analyzing data to identify potential risks that an insurance company might face. we will use statistical models and historical data to predict the likelihood of future events, such as natural disasters, accidents, or other claim-triggering incidents. Accurate risk assessment is crucial for setting appropriate premiums and ensuring the financial stability of the insurance company.

### 2. Pricing

One of the core responsibilities is determining the pricing of insurance policies. This process, known as ratemaking, involves calculating the premiums that policyholders must pay. we will use various actuarial methods, such as experience-based rating, which relies on historical claims data to set rates. The goal is to balance competitiveness with profitability, ensuring that the premiums are sufficient to cover future claims and expenses while remaining attractive to customers.

### 3. Reserving

Actuarial analysts must ensure that the insurance company sets aside sufficient reserves to pay future claims. This involves estimating the amount of money needed to cover claims that have been reported but not yet settled, as well as claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported. Accurate reserving helps maintain the financial health of the company and ensures that it can meet its obligations to policyholders.

### 4. Financial reporting

we will also be responsible for providing detailed financial reports to management. These reports include analyses of the company's claims experience, loss ratios, and overall financial performance. wer insights will help inform strategic decisions, such as setting underwriting guidelines, developing new insurance products, and adjusting pricing strategies.

### 5. Regulatory compliance

Compliance with regulatory requirements is another critical aspect of this role. we must ensure that the insurance company's pricing models and reserves meet the standards set by regulatory bodies. This involves staying up-to-date with changes in regulations and ensuring that all actuarial practices are in line with legal requirements.

## II. Basics of marine insurance perils and coverages

### 1. Overview of marine insurance

Marine insurance provides coverage for ships, cargo, terminals, and any transport or cargo by which property is transferred, acquired, or held between the points of origin and final destination. It plays a crucial role in international trade, safeguarding against various risks associated with maritime activities.

### 2. Common marine insurance perils

Marine insurance covers a wide range of perils that can cause damage or loss. Some of the most common include:

*Sinking*: When a vessel goes down due to severe weather, collision, or other catastrophic events.
*Collision*: Damage resulting from a vessel colliding with another ship, a stationary object, or submerged rocks.
*Piracy*: The criminal act of attacking and robbing ships at sea, which can lead to loss of cargo and vessel damage.
*Fire*: Fires can occur on ships due to various reasons, including onboard accidents or external factors like lightning strikes.
*Weather*: Severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, typhoons, and storms can cause significant damage to vessels and cargo.

### 3. Types of marine insurance coverages

Marine insurance policies are designed to cover specific types of risks and can be tailored to meet the needs of different stakeholders. Key coverages include:

*Hull insurance*: Covers physical damage to the ship itself, including the machinery and equipment onboard.
*Cargo insurance*: Protects against loss or damage to the goods being transported. This coverage can be extended to cover different stages of transit, including loading and unloading.
*Freight insurance*: Ensures the shipowner or charterer is compensated for lost income if the cargo is lost or damaged.
*Protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance*: Provides coverage for third-party liabilities, including injuries to crew and passengers and damage to cargo or other ships.

### 4. Marine Third-Party Liability

Marine Third-Party Liability insurance, a crucial aspect of P&I coverage, specifically covers the shipowner's legal liabilities to third parties. This can include:

*Bodily injury or death*: Liability arising from injury or death of third parties, including passengers and crew members.
*Property damage*: Damage caused by the insured vessel to other vessels, docks, cargo, and other properties.
*Pollution liability*: Coverage for expenses related to oil spills or other types of marine pollution caused by the insured vessel.
*Wreck removal*: Costs associated with the removal of the wreckage of the insured vessel if it sinks or is otherwise rendered inoperable.

## III. Introduction to pricing and pricing analyses

### 1. Importance of pricing in insurance

Pricing, or ratemaking, is a critical function in the insurance industry. It involves determining the premium rates that policyholders must pay for their coverage. The goal is to set rates that are competitive yet sufficient to cover expected claims and expenses and provide a reasonable profit margin. Effective pricing ensures the financial stability of the insurance company and maintains fairness among policyholders.

### 2. Factors influencing insurance pricing

Several key factors influence the pricing of insurance policies:

*Risk assessment*: Understanding the likelihood and potential cost of claims is fundamental. This involves analyzing historical data, current trends, and predictive models.
*Coverage types: The specific types of coverage and the limits of each policy directly impact pricing. More comprehensive coverage typically results in higher premiums.
*Market conditions*: Competitive landscape, economic factors, and regulatory environment also play a role in setting prices.
*Operational costs*: The expenses associated with underwriting, claims handling, and overall administration must be factored into the pricing.

### 3. Experience-based rating

Experience-based rating is a common method used in pricing insurance policies. This approach sets premiums based on the historical claims experience of the insured or a group of similar insureds. Key elements include:

*Loss experience*: Historical data on the frequency and severity of claims is analyzed to predict future losses. This data is often adjusted to account for trends, inflation, and other relevant factors.
*Credibility*: The extent to which past experience can be relied upon to predict future outcomes. Higher credibility is given to larger datasets with consistent historical patterns.
*Adjustment factors*: Modifications for inflation, changes in exposure, and other relevant adjustments are used to refine the pricing model.

### 4. Steps in conducting a pricing analysis

Conducting a pricing analysis involves several key steps:

*Data collection*: Gather historical claims data, policy details, and relevant external data such as economic indicators.
*Data cleaning and preparation*: Ensure the data is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly for analysis. This may involve removing outliers and adjusting for anomalies.
*Risk assessment*: Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends in claims frequency and severity. Use statistical models to estimate future risks.
*Rate calculation*: Apply experience-based rating methods to calculate the base rates. Adjust these rates for various factors such as policy limits, deductibles, and coverage options.
*Validation and testing*: Validate the pricing model using different datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability. Adjust the model as necessary based on the results.
*Documentation and reporting*: Prepare a detailed report outlining the pricing methodology, assumptions, calculations, and final rates. Include commentary on any uncertainties or risks identified during the analysis.
